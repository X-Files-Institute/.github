## How to use?
In this organization, each member has the highest level of authority (Admin). Of course, you can directly create warehouses in the organization to collaborate with everyone, but this has security risks: you cannot prevent others from pushing to your warehouse, so We recommend that you create a warehouse under your own account and transfer it to the organization. Members of the organization can make changes to your warehouse, but you will always maintain an original warehouse under your own account, which can be initiated through the warehouse in the organization pr to update the original repository.
